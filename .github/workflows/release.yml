            ### What's New in v1.3.0 - Security & Integrity

            #### Security Features
            - **8-Level Trust Status System** with color-coded visual indicators
            - **SHA256 Binary Hashing** for process verification
            - **Authenticode Signature Verification** using Windows WinVerifyTrust API
            - **Microsoft Signature Detection** with certificate inspection
            - **Manual Trust Override System** with persistent encrypted storage (DPAPI)
            - **Visual Legend** showing all trust levels with distinct colors
            - **Lock Icon Indicator (üîí)** for manually overridden entries

            #### Trust Levels
            - üü¢ **Microsoft Signed** (‚úì‚úì) - Windows/Microsoft processes (highest trust)
            - üü¢ **Verified Signed** (‚úì) - Digitally signed by verified publisher
            - üü° **Manually Trusted** (üîíüëç) - User-marked as trusted
            - üü† **Unsigned** (‚óã) - No digital signature (caution)
            - üî¥ **Invalid** (‚úó) - Invalid or expired signature
            - üî¥ **Manually Threat** (üîí‚ö†) - User-marked as threat
            - ‚ö™ **Error** (!) - Verification error
            - ‚ö™ **Unknown** (?) - Verification in progress

            #### UI Improvements
            - **Trust Level Filtering** dropdown in toolbar
            - **Color-coded Connection Table** rows based on trust status
            - **Right-Click Context Menu** to manually override trust decisions
            - **Multithreaded Verification** for responsive UI (8 worker threads)

            #### Security Hardening
            - Encrypted trust overrides with DPAPI (Windows Data Protection API)
            - ACL protection limiting file access to current user only
            - Atomic file writes with crash recovery
            - Persistent per-path trust decisions

            ### Core Features (v1.1 - v1.2)
            - Real-time network connection monitoring (TCP & UDP)
            - IPv4 and IPv6 support
            - Connection direction detection (Inbound/Outbound)
            - Localhost connection filtering
            - Protocol filtering (TCP/UDP/All)
            - Connection grouping by process and endpoint
            - Visual flash effects for new connections
            - Administrator privilege detection
            - Clean light theme UI

            ### Installation
            1. Download `Peek-${{ github.ref_name }}-Windows-x64.zip`
            2. Extract the archive
            3. Run `Peek.exe` (administrator privileges recommended for full functionality)

            ### Requirements
            - Windows 10/11
            - x64 architecture
            - Administrator privileges (recommended)

            ### Usage Tips
            - **View Trust Status**: Colors and symbols in the Trust column show binary security status
            - **Filter by Trust**: Use the "Trust:" dropdown to see only specific trust levels
            - **Override Trust**: Right-click on any connection to manually mark as Trusted or Threat
            - **Monitor Unsigned Binaries**: Orange rows indicate unsigned executables (potential risk)

            ### Files
            - `Peek-${{ github.ref_name }}-Windows-x64.zip`: Complete package with assets
            - `Peek.exe`: Standalone executable (code-signed)

            ### Security Note
            v1.3.0 adds comprehensive security analysis capabilities. The trust system helps identify potentially suspicious network activity by unsigned or invalid binaries. However, signature verification is not a guarantee of safety - always review what processes are connecting to the network.
