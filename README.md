**A real-time network connection monitor for Windows, built in pure C with the Win32 API.**
Peek lets you instantly see which processes are talking to which destinations — inbound or outbound — in a clean, animated, and filterable interface.

</div>

## Overview

**PEEK** is a lightweight, open-source network monitoring tool written in C. It provides real-time visibility into TCP and UDP connections (both IPv4 and IPv6) established on your Windows machine, with intelligent filtering and process association.

It aims to fill the gap between heavy tools like Wireshark and limited CLI utilities like `netstat`, offering a **modern, GUI-driven experience** without sacrificing performance.

## Core Modules

### **1. Network Module (`network.c/h`)**

Responsible for querying Windows APIs to fetch active TCP/UDP connections (IPv4 & IPv6) and determine their direction (INBOUND / OUTBOUND).

Key APIs:

* `GetExtendedTcpTable()` / `GetExtendedUdpTable()` for active and listening sockets (IPv4 & IPv6)
* `OpenProcess()` / `QueryFullProcessImageNameA()` for process names
* `EnumProcessModules()` / `GetModuleBaseNameA()` for enhanced process name resolution

PEEK introduces a precise **direction detection algorithm**:

1. Retrieve all listening ports with `TCP_TABLE_OWNER_PID_LISTENER`.
2. Compare each connection's local port and PID:

    * If it matches a listening port → **INBOUND**
    * Otherwise → **OUTBOUND**

**Enhanced process name resolution:**
* Multiple access level attempts (from limited to full access)
* Fallback to PSAPI for system processes
* Special handling for System (PID 4) and System Idle (PID 0)
* Administrator privilege detection with user warning

It also tracks connection stats and maintains a cached table of seen connections for efficient updates.

---

### **2. GUI Module (`gui.c/h`)**

Handles the entire Win32 user interface: ListView, filters, buttons, animations, and security indicators.

**Features:**

* Real-time connection table with direction and protocol indicators
* Filtering by direction (Inbound / Outbound / All)
* Filtering by protocol (TCP / UDP / All) with dropdown selector
* Filtering by trust level (Microsoft Signed / Verified / Unsigned / Invalid / etc.) with dropdown selector
* Toggle for localhost traffic visibility
* Smart grouping by process, protocol, and endpoint
* Flash animation for new or updated connections
* IPv6 address display support
* **Security & Trust Status Features (v1.3.0+):**
  - Visual trust status legend with color coding (8 levels)
  - Color-coded rows based on binary signature verification status
  - Manual trust override system (right-click context menu)
  - Lock icon (🔒) indicator for user-defined trust overrides
  - Trust symbols: ✓✓ (Microsoft), ✓ (Verified), 🔒👍 (Trusted), ○ (Unsigned), ✗ (Invalid), 🔒⚠ (Threat), ! (Error), ? (Unknown)
  - SHA256 binary hashing display

### **3. Logger Module (`logger.c/h`)**

Provides colorful console logging with timestamps and levels:

```
[16:54:41] [INFO ] Starting PEEK - Network Monitor
[16:54:41] [OK   ] Network module initialized (33 connections)
[16:54:43] [ERROR] Network initialization failed
```

Supports ANSI escape codes and auto-enables VT sequences in Windows Terminal.

---

### **4. Main Module (`main.c`)**

Handles initialization and orchestration of all subsystems.

```c
int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, ...) {
    logger_init();

    // Check administrator privileges and warn user if not elevated
    if (!IsRunningAsAdmin()) {
        // Show warning popup with option to continue or exit
    }

    if (network_init() != 0) return 1;
    gui_init(hInstance);
    gui_create_window(hInstance);
    int result = gui_run();
    network_cleanup();
    return result;
}
```

## Performance

| Resource | Typical usage         |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| CPU      | ~1–3% (500ms polling) |
| RAM      | ~15–25 MB             |
| Disk     | 0 – no file logs      |
| Network  | 0 – system APIs only  |

Optimized for low overhead via static arrays, caching, and minimal redraw logic.

---

## Permissions

| Mode          | Access level                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Standard User | Own processes + limited system visibility |
| Administrator | Full system-wide visibility (all PIDs)    |

PEEK runs without admin rights, but some system process names may appear as `[System] PID:xxx`. For full functionality, run as administrator. PEEK will show a warning popup if not elevated, with the option to continue or exit.

---

## Typical Use Cases

| Role      | Problem                              | Solution                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Developer | "Where does my app connect?"         | Outbound filter by process |
| Sysadmin  | "Who connects to my web server?"     | Inbound + port filter      |
| Security  | "Is this process exfiltrating data?" | Outbound + process monitor |
